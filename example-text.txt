This product is absolutely terrible and a complete waste of money.
It’s poorly designed, unreliable, and falls apart after minimal use.
I am incredibly disappointed with the quality,
and it’s frustrating to see such blatant disregard for customer satisfaction.
The instructions were confusing and full of errors, making it nearly impossible to use correctly.
On top of that, the customer service was unhelpful, rude, and dismissive of my concerns.
I’ve never encountered something so awful and utterly useless.
The materials feel cheap, and it doesn’t work as advertised.
Honestly, I regret this purchase more than anything else I’ve bought recently.
It’s the worst experience I’ve ever had,
and I would strongly advise everyone to avoid this product at all costs.
